// Chapter 01
> Go provides a viable alternative to existing languages and platforms for developing
large-scale web applications. Large-scale web applications typically need to be
- Scalable
- Modular
- Maintainable
- High-performance

Go scales well vertically with its excellent support for concurrent programming. A sin-
gle Go web application with a single OS thread can be scheduled to run hundreds of
thousands of goroutines with efficiency and performance.

Go web applications are
compiled as static binaries, without any dynamic dependencies, and can be distributed
to systems that don’t have Go built in.

Web application is a computer program that
responds to an HTTP request by a client and sends HTML back to the client in an HTTP
response.

In comparison, a web application doesn’t simply return
files; it processes the request and performs operations that are programmed into the
application.
